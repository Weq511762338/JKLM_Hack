## User Guide ðŸ“–
### Instruction
1. Hover the cursor over the word in the center
2. When it is your turn, press `shift` to select the word for processing
3. Type in the prompted word!

### Features
- If `Auto Paste Mode` is on, the 1st word on the list will be auto-pasted after processing the selected syllable
- If `Long Word Mode` is on, the prompted words will be as long as possible, essentially for a higher chance of using more letters and earning an extra life.

## Installation ðŸ’»
- Require `python` installed.
- Should work on Windows and MacOS

1. After downloading the prompter, run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all Python packages used.
2. Then just run `$ python ./JKLM_Prompter/src/main.py`
3. A `wxpython` window should pop up :)

## Important Notes
- `keyboard` module will read keypresses from the whole OS. So remember to close the program if you are going to use `shift` key somewhere else
- The wordlist for JKLM BombParty is not published publicly. Some of the words may be rejected. Just pick another one!
- Do not move the cursor from the syllable in the center. Adjust its position so that pressing `shift` can accurately select the word.
- This is for educational purpose only.
